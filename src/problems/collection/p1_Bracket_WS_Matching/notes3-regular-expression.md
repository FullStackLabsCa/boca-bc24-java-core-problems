The regular expression `"[(){}\\[\\]]*"` is used to validate that a string contains only specific characters (i.e., parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`). Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Breakdown of the Regular Expression

- **`[ ... ]`**:
    - This denotes a character class, which matches any single character within the brackets. For example, `[abc]` would match either 'a', 'b', or 'c'.

- **`()`**:
    - Inside the character class, `()` matches either an opening or closing parenthesis.

- **`{}`**:
    - Similarly, `{}` matches either an opening or closing curly brace.

- **`\\[` and `\\]`**:
    - `[` and `]` are special characters in regular expressions, used to define character classes. To match literal square brackets, you must escape them with a backslash (`\`).
    - In Java, the backslash itself needs to be escaped in strings, so you use double backslashes (`\\`) to match literal square brackets. `\\[` matches `[`, and `\\]` matches `]`.

- **`*`**:
    - This quantifier means "zero or more occurrences" of the preceding character class. So, `"[(){}\\[\\]]*"` allows any string that consists of zero or more characters from the set `()`, `{}`, `[]`.

### Putting It All Together

The expression `"[(){}\\[\\]]*"` matches a string that may contain any combination of the following characters: `()`, `{}`, `[]`, and nothing else. The `*` ensures that the entire string, no matter how long, is composed only of these characters.

### Example Matches
- `"[]"` → Valid (matches `[]`)
- `"{}()"` → Valid (matches `{}`, `()`)
- `"([{}])"` → Valid (matches `()`, `[]`, `{}`)
- `"abc"` → Invalid (contains characters outside `()`, `{}`, `[]`)

The basic structure of the `MyHashMap` class and the bucket array, let's proceed with the next steps: implementing the core methods for adding, retrieving, and removing key-value pairs, as well as handling hash collisions.

### Steps:
1. **Hashing Function**: Create a method to compute the hash and index.
2. **Put Method**: Add key-value pairs to the correct bucket, handle updates, and collisions.
3. **Get Method**: Retrieve the value associated with a key.
4. **Remove Method**: Remove the key-value pair from the map.
5. **Collision Handling**: Handle collisions by chaining (using linked lists in each bucket).

#### 1. **Hash Function**
Weâ€™ll use the `hashCode()` method provided by Java for hashing the key and map it to the correct bucket index.

#### 2. **Put Method**
Add a key-value pair to the map. If the key already exists, update its value; otherwise, add the new node at the correct index.


#### 3. **Get Method**
Retrieve the value associated with the key.

#### 4. **Remove Method**
Remove the key-value pair from the map.

#### 5. **Size and ContainsKey Methods**
We can also implement additional utility methods.


With these methods, `MyHashMap` implementation is capable of basic operations like adding, retrieving, and removing key-value pairs with proper collision handling.

-------------------------------------------

A quick summary of done and what might be next:

### Summary
1. **Basic Structure**: Defined `Node` and `MyHashMap` with a bucket array.
2. **Hash Function**: Created a method to map keys to bucket indices.
3. **Core Methods**:
    - `put(K key, V value)`: Adds or updates key-value pairs.
    - `get(K key)`: Retrieves values associated with keys.
    - `remove(K key)`: Removes key-value pairs.
    - `containsKey(K key)`: Checks if a key exists.
    - `size()`: Returns the number of key-value pairs.

### Next Steps (Optional)
1. **Dynamic Resizing**: Implement resizing of the bucket array if needed.
2. **Null Key Handling**: Optionally, handle `null` keys if required.
3. **Testing**: Write tests to ensure your `MyHashMap` behaves as expected.


### Summary
- Node Class: Represents key-value pairs.
- MyHashMap Class: Manages the bucket array, handles dynamic resizing, manages key-value pairs, and deals with collisions using chaining.
- Dynamic Resizing: Increases bucket array size when needed.
- Null Key Handling: Optionally manages null keys.

### SQL SELECT Statement
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

### SELECT Syntax
```declarative
SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM tablename;
```

Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:

```declarative
SELECT * FROM tablename;
```

SELECT Column Example
The following SQL statement selects the "first_name" and "last_name" columns from the "patients" table:

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM patients;

SELECT * Example
The following SQL statement selects all the columns from the "patients" table:

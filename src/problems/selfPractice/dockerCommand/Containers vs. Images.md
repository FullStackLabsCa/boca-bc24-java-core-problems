It looks like you might be viewing the list of Docker images rather than containers. The `docker rm mysql` command is used to remove a Docker container, not an image. Here’s how you can distinguish between Docker containers and images, and how to address the issue:

### **Understanding Docker Containers vs. Images**

- **Containers** are instances of Docker images that are running or have been stopped. They are temporary and can be started, stopped, and removed.
- **Images** are read-only templates used to create containers. They are the base files that get executed in containers.

### **Check Containers**

To verify that the container has been removed:

1. **List All Containers (Including Stopped):**

   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

   This should show whether any container named `mysql` exists. If the container was successfully removed, it shouldn’t be listed here.

2. **Remove a Container:**

   If you still see the `mysql` container in the output, you might need to stop it before removing it:

   ```bash
   docker stop mysql
   docker rm mysql
   ```

### **Check Images**

To list Docker images and see the `bitnami/mysql` image:

1. **List All Docker Images:**

   ```bash
   docker images
   ```

   This will show you a list of all images available locally, including `bitnami/mysql`.

### **Remove Docker Images**

If you want to remove the Docker image `bitnami/mysql`, you need to make sure no containers are using it. If you’re sure no containers are using it:

1. **Remove the Image:**

   ```bash
   docker rmi bitnami/mysql
   ```

   If you get an error that the image is in use, make sure no containers are using it by listing containers and stopping/removing them first.

### **Troubleshooting**

1. **If You Encounter Issues Removing Containers:**

    - **Force Removal of a Container:**
      ```bash
      docker rm -f mysql
      ```

    - **Check for Running Containers:**
      ```bash
      docker ps
      ```

2. **If You Encounter Issues Removing Images:**

    - **Check if Containers Are Using the Image:**
      ```bash
      docker ps -a --filter ancestor=bitnami/mysql
      ```

    - **Force Removal of the Image (if necessary):**
      ```bash
      docker rmi -f bitnami/mysql
      ```

### **Summary**

- **To Remove a Container:** Use `docker rm mysql`.
- **To Remove an Image:** Ensure no containers are using it, then use `docker rmi bitnami/mysql`.

---------------------------------------------

If you’ve removed a Docker container using `docker rm mysql`, and you want to run a new MySQL container, you’ll need to use the `docker run` command to start a fresh instance. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### **1. Start a New MySQL Container**

You can start a new MySQL container using the `docker run` command. Here’s a basic example to run a MySQL container with the Bitnami MySQL image:

```bash
docker run --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password123 -p 3306:3306 -d bitnami/mysql:latest
```

- **`--name mysql`**: Assigns the name `mysql` to the new container.
- **`-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password123`**: Sets the root password for MySQL to `password123`.
- **`-p 3306:3306`**: Maps port `3306` on your host to port `3306` on the container, making MySQL accessible from your host.
- **`-d`**: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- **`bitnami/mysql:latest`**: Specifies the Docker image to use.

### **2. Verify the Container is Running**

After starting the container, you can verify that it’s running with:

```bash
docker ps
```

This command will list all running containers. You should see your new `mysql` container listed here.

### **3. Connect to MySQL**

To connect to the MySQL server running in your Docker container, use:

```bash
mysql -u root -p -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306
```

Enter the password `password123` when prompted.

### **4. Check Logs (Optional)**

If you want to check the logs for any issues or confirm that MySQL is running properly:

```bash
docker logs mysql
```

### **5. Manage Containers and Images**

- **List All Containers (Including Stopped):**
  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```

- **Remove a Container:**
  ```bash
  docker rm mysql
  ```

- **List All Docker Images:**
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```

- **Remove an Image:**
  ```bash
  docker rmi bitnami/mysql
  ```

### **Example Workflow**

1. **Remove Old Container (if needed):**
   ```bash
   docker stop mysql
   docker rm mysql
   ```

2. **Run New Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password123 -p 3306:3306 -d bitnami/mysql:latest
   ```

3. **Check Running Containers:**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

4. **Connect to MySQL:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306
   ```

By following these steps, you can successfully run and manage a new MySQL container. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, just let me know!

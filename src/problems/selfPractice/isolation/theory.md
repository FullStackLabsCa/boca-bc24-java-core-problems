The basics of **transaction isolation levels** in MySQL.

### **1. What is a Transaction?**

A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. The key properties of transactions are often summarized by the acronym **ACID**:
- **Atomicity:** The transaction is all-or-nothing. It either completes fully or doesn’t complete at all.
- **Consistency:** The database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction.
- **Isolation:** Transactions are isolated from each other until they are completed.
- **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent.

### **2. Isolation Levels Overview**

Isolation levels determine how transaction integrity is maintained when multiple transactions are executed concurrently. The goal is to balance the need for consistency against the need for concurrency.

Here are the **four isolation levels** defined by SQL standards:

#### **a. READ UNCOMMITTED**

- **Description:** Allows transactions to read uncommitted changes made by other transactions. This is the lowest isolation level.
- **Pros:** Provides the highest level of concurrency but the lowest level of data integrity.
- **Cons:** Can lead to "dirty reads" (reading data that has not yet been committed and might be rolled back).

**Example Scenario:** If Transaction A updates a row but has not yet committed, Transaction B can read that uncommitted data.

#### **b. READ COMMITTED**

- **Description:** Ensures that any data read during a transaction is committed at the moment it is read. It prevents dirty reads.
- **Pros:** Provides a balance between consistency and concurrency.
- **Cons:** Can still suffer from "non-repeatable reads" (where a row read by one transaction may be changed by another transaction before the first transaction completes).

**Example Scenario:** Transaction A updates a row and commits. Transaction B, reading the same row, will only see the committed data.

#### **c. REPEATABLE READ**

- **Description:** Ensures that if a transaction reads a row, it will see the same data if it reads the row again later, even if other transactions modify the data in between. It prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads.
- **Pros:** Provides a higher level of consistency compared to READ COMMITTED.
- **Cons:** May still allow "phantom reads" (where a transaction reads a set of rows and finds that the set has changed if it repeats the read).

**Example Scenario:** If Transaction A reads a set of rows, any other transaction adding new rows to that set won't affect what Transaction A sees.

#### **d. SERIALIZABLE**

- **Description:** The highest isolation level. Transactions are executed in such a way that the result is as if they were executed serially, one after the other. This prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
- **Pros:** Provides the highest level of consistency.
- **Cons:** Can lead to significant performance degradation due to reduced concurrency.

**Example Scenario:** Transaction A and Transaction B both need to access the same set of rows. Serializable isolation ensures that one transaction will fully complete before the other begins.

### **3. Setting Isolation Levels in MySQL**

You can set the isolation level in MySQL at different levels:
- **Global:** Affects all sessions and transactions.
- **Session:** Affects only the current session.
- **Transaction:** Affects only the current transaction.

**Examples:**

- **Setting Global Isolation Level:**
  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
  ```

- **Setting Session Isolation Level:**
  ```sql
  SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
  ```

- **Setting Transaction Isolation Level:**
  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
  ```

### **4. Practical Considerations**

- **Choosing Isolation Level:** The choice depends on your application’s need for consistency vs. performance. For instance, a banking application might require a higher isolation level to ensure data accuracy, while a logging system might be okay with a lower isolation level for better performance.
- **Testing:** Always test the behavior of your transactions under different isolation levels to understand how they impact your application’s performance and consistency.

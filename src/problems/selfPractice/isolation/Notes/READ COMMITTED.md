Sure, let’s break down the scenario involving the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level and what happens with transactions in this context.

### `READ COMMITTED` Isolation Level

The `READ COMMITTED` isolation level is one of the standard isolation levels in SQL databases. Here’s a summary of how it works:

- **Read Committed** ensures that any data read during a transaction is committed at the moment it is read. This means that a transaction will not see uncommitted changes made by other transactions.
- However, the data a transaction reads might change if another transaction commits changes to that data while the first transaction is still running.

### The Scenario

Let’s break down your example:

1. **Transaction A** starts and performs a `SELECT` query to read data.
2. **Transaction B** starts, updates the same row that Transaction A has read, and commits the update.
3. After Transaction B commits, Transaction A could potentially re-read the data and see the changes made by Transaction B if it executes another `SELECT` query.

Here’s a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Transaction A:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = 1;
   ```
   At this point, Transaction A reads the row where `id = 1`. Assume the initial balance is $500.

2. **Transaction B:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 1;
   COMMIT;
   ```
   Transaction B updates the balance by adding $100 and commits the change. Now, the balance for `id = 1` is $600.

3. **Transaction A (Re-reading or doing another operation):**
   If Transaction A performs another `SELECT` query or similar operation after Transaction B has committed, it will see the updated balance of $600.

### Key Points

- **Visibility of Changes:** Transaction A will only see the committed changes from Transaction B if it re-reads the data after Transaction B has committed. Initially, when Transaction A performed its `SELECT`, it saw the balance of $500. It will not see the updated balance of $600 until it performs another `SELECT` query after Transaction B's commit.

- **Inconsistent Results:** During the time when Transaction A is active, if it reads the data before Transaction B commits, it will not see the changes made by Transaction B. This is because `READ COMMITTED` ensures that only committed changes are visible to a transaction. If Transaction A reads the data again after Transaction B commits, it will see the updated data.

### Summary

With `READ COMMITTED`, each read operation in a transaction only sees the committed state of the data at the time of the read. So, Transaction A will see the data as it was at the time of each read operation. If Transaction B commits changes that Transaction A's ongoing transaction does not yet see, Transaction A will only see these changes if it reads the data again after the commit. This isolation level prevents dirty reads but allows for non-repeatable reads (where repeated reads within the same transaction might show different results if other transactions commit in between).

-----------------------------------------
Sure, let’s break down what’s happening here in the context of the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level:

### Isolation Levels Overview

Isolation levels control how transactions interact with each other and determine how changes made by one transaction are visible to others. The `READ COMMITTED` isolation level is one of these levels, and it ensures that any data read during a transaction is committed at that moment. However, it does not prevent all types of concurrency issues.

### `READ COMMITTED` Isolation Level

In the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level:
- **Dirty Reads:** These are prevented. A transaction can only read data that has been committed.
- **Non-repeatable Reads:** These can occur. If a transaction reads a row of data, another transaction can modify that row before the first transaction is finished. If the first transaction re-reads the row, it may see a different value.

### The Scenario

Let’s go through the given scenario:

1. **Transaction A:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 50 WHERE id = 1;
   COMMIT;
   ```
   - **What Happens:** Transaction A updates the `balance` of account `1` by subtracting 50 and then commits this change.

2. **Transaction B:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 1;
   COMMIT;
   ```
   - **What Happens:** Transaction B updates the `balance` of account `1` by adding 100 and then commits this change.

### Interaction and Effects

- **Dirty Reads:** This isolation level prevents dirty reads, so Transaction A’s changes are not visible to Transaction B until A commits, and vice versa. In other words, Transaction B can’t see changes made by Transaction A until A has committed.

- **Non-repeatable Reads:** Suppose Transaction A reads the `balance` before making its update. If Transaction B then updates the same row and commits, and then Transaction A tries to read the `balance` again, it might see a different value due to Transaction B’s changes. This is what’s meant by non-repeatable reads: the data can change if read multiple times within the same transaction.

### Example in Context

1. **Before any transactions:**
   - `balance` for account `1` is $500.

2. **Transaction A starts:**
   - Reads balance: $500.
   - Updates balance to $450 (`balance - 50`).
   - Commits.

3. **Transaction B starts:**
   - Reads balance: $450 (because Transaction A’s changes are now committed and visible).
   - Updates balance to $550 (`balance + 100`).
   - Commits.

4. **If Transaction A re-reads the balance after Transaction B has committed:**
   - Transaction A might see $550 instead of the $450 it saw before, illustrating the non-repeatable read issue.

### Summary

With `READ COMMITTED`:
- **No dirty reads** occur because each transaction reads only committed data.
- **Non-repeatable reads** can happen because a transaction might see different data if it reads the same row more than once during its lifecycle due to updates by other transactions.

This behavior is a trade-off that balances the need to prevent dirty reads while allowing for some level of concurrency.

-----------------------------------------
Let's clarify the scenario you described with the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level and its impact on SELECT operations at the table level.

### Scenario Breakdown

1. **Isolation Level: READ COMMITTED**
   - This isolation level ensures that any data read by a transaction is committed at that moment. However, it does not prevent all concurrency issues, particularly non-repeatable reads.

2. **Transactions:**

   - **Transaction A (Read Operation):**
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id > 5;
     ```
      - **Purpose:** This transaction reads all rows in the `accounts` table where the `id` is greater than 5.

   - **Transaction B (Update Operation):**
     ```sql
     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id > 5;
     COMMIT;
     ```
      - **Purpose:** This transaction updates the `balance` of all rows where the `id` is greater than 5 and then commits the changes.

### Interaction and Effects

- **Before Transaction B Commits:**
   - Transaction A will see the state of the `accounts` table as it was before Transaction B started or made its updates. Since Transaction B’s changes are not yet committed, Transaction A cannot see those changes.

- **After Transaction B Commits:**
   - Transaction A will see the committed state of the `accounts` table as of the point when it reads data. However, since `READ COMMITTED` allows for non-repeatable reads, if Transaction A re-reads the table after Transaction B has committed, it might see the updated rows.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initial State:**
   - Assume the `accounts` table initially has rows with `id > 5` and a certain balance.

2. **Transaction A Starts and Reads:**
   - Transaction A executes `SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id > 5;`. It will see the data as it existed at the start of Transaction A.

3. **Transaction B Executes and Commits:**
   - Transaction B updates the balances of all rows where `id > 5` and commits those changes.

4. **Impact on Transaction A:**
   - If Transaction A continues to run and does not re-read the data, it will not see the changes made by Transaction B.
   - If Transaction A re-executes the `SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id > 5;` after Transaction B commits, it will see the updated balances because Transaction B’s updates are now visible to it.

### Key Points

- **No Dirty Reads:** Transaction A cannot see uncommitted changes from Transaction B; it only sees committed data.
- **Non-Repeatable Reads:** Transaction A might see different data if it re-reads the table after Transaction B has committed, as Transaction B’s updates become visible.

### Summary

In the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level:
- **Only committed data** from Transaction B is visible to Transaction A.
- **Non-repeatable reads** can occur. If Transaction A reads the table initially and then re-reads it after Transaction B has committed, it will see the updated data reflecting Transaction B’s changes.

This behavior ensures that each read operation within a transaction sees a consistent view of the database at the moment of the read but does not prevent changes from being seen if the transaction re-reads the data after other transactions have committed their updates.

**4.**
---------------------------

Certainly! Let's delve into the scenario you provided with the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level and its impact on concurrent updates at the table level.

### Scenario Overview

1. **Isolation Level: READ COMMITTED**
   - In this level, a transaction can only see data that has been committed at the time it reads. It prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads.

2. **Transactions:**

   - **Transaction A:**
     ```sql
     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 50 WHERE id > 5;
     COMMIT;
     ```
      - **Purpose:** This transaction updates the `balance` for all rows in the `accounts` table where `id > 5` by subtracting 50 and commits the changes.

   - **Transaction B:**
     ```sql
     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id <= 5;
     COMMIT;
     ```
      - **Purpose:** This transaction updates the `balance` for all rows where `id <= 5` by adding 100 and commits the changes.

### Key Points of Interaction and Effects

1. **Independence of Updates:**
   - **Updates on Different Rows:** Since Transaction A and Transaction B are updating different sets of rows (one affects rows with `id > 5` and the other affects rows with `id <= 5`), their updates do not interfere with each other. They are modifying distinct subsets of the data, so there are no conflicts between the two transactions.

2. **Non-Repeatable Reads:**
   - **Initial Read by Transaction A:** If Transaction A reads data before committing its update, it will see the balances before the update. After it commits, if any other transaction (including Transaction B) reads the data, it will see the new balances.
   - **Non-Repeatable Read Example:** Suppose Transaction A reads all rows where `id > 5`, then Transaction B updates the rows where `id <= 5` and commits. If Transaction A re-reads the rows it previously read, it will still see the same rows (because it’s not affected by Transaction B’s updates). However, if Transaction A starts a new read operation after Transaction B has committed, it would not be impacted by the changes in Transaction B.

3. **Impact of Non-Repeatable Reads:**
   - **Impact on Transaction A:** Transaction A’s updates are isolated from the updates in Transaction B as they are targeting different rows. But if Transaction A had started a read operation and then re-read the data after Transaction B committed its changes, any overlap in rows could result in Transaction A seeing a different state of those rows (if Transaction A had read rows affected by Transaction B).

### Summary

- **Concurrent Updates on Different Rows:** Since Transaction A and Transaction B are updating different rows, their updates do not interfere with each other. Both transactions can commit their changes without causing conflicts or errors because they are modifying non-overlapping subsets of the data.

- **No Dirty Reads:** At `READ COMMITTED`, Transaction A and B see only committed data, preventing dirty reads.

- **Potential Non-Repeatable Reads:** Although updates from Transaction B do not interfere with Transaction A's operations directly, if Transaction A were to re-read rows that have been affected by Transaction B, it would see the new data committed by Transaction B. This reflects the non-repeatable read phenomenon where data read earlier in a transaction may change if re-read later in the same or another transaction.

```declarative
ThresholdInput thresholdInput = new ThresholdInput();
double effectiveThreshold = thresholdInput.threshholdUserFileInput();

vs 

double effectiveThreshold = ThresholdInput.threshholdUserFileInput(args);
```

The difference between the two lines of code lies in how you are calling the method and the context in which the method is executed. Let’s break down each approach:

### 1. Instance Method Call
```java
ThresholdInput thresholdInput = new ThresholdInput();
double effectiveThreshold = thresholdInput.threshholdUserFileInput();
```
- **Instance Creation:** This code creates an instance of the `ThresholdInput` class.
- **Instance Method:** It calls the `threshholdUserFileInput()` method on that specific instance.
- **State:** If `threshholdUserFileInput()` relies on any instance variables (fields) of `ThresholdInput`, it can access them. This is useful if the method needs to maintain or utilize state across multiple calls.

### 2. Static Method Call
```java
double effectiveThreshold = ThresholdInput.threshholdUserFileInput(args);
```
- **Static Method Call:** This code assumes that `threshholdUserFileInput()` is a static method of the `ThresholdInput` class.
- **No Instance Needed:** You don’t need to create an instance of `ThresholdInput` to call this method, which can make the call more straightforward and cleaner if the method does not depend on instance-specific data.
- **Parameters:** You can pass parameters directly to the method, like `args`, without needing an object.

### Summary
- **Instance Method:** Requires an object of the class. Can access instance variables. Useful if the method needs to operate on or modify the state of the instance.
- **Static Method:** Called on the class itself. Does not require an instance. Suitable for utility functions that do not depend on instance variables.

### When to Use Which
- Use an **instance method** if you need to maintain state or use instance variables.
- Use a **static method** if the method is a utility function that doesn't depend on any instance-specific data.

If `threshholdUserFileInput()` is designed to operate independently of object state, it’s often better to make it static for convenience. If it does need to work with instance variables, it should remain an instance method.

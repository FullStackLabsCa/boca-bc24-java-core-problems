There are several types of queues in Java, and each has different characteristics depending on the use case. Here's why I suggested `LinkedBlockingDeque` and how it compares to other queues like `ArrayBlockingQueue`:

### Why `LinkedBlockingDeque`?
1. **Unbounded Option**: By default, `LinkedBlockingDeque` is unbounded unless you specify a capacity. This can be useful if you're uncertain about how many trades will be added, as it prevents the queue from blocking prematurely.

2. **Double-ended Queue**: `LinkedBlockingDeque` is a **deque (double-ended queue)**, meaning it allows adding and removing elements from both ends of the queue. Although in this case we're primarily adding elements from one end, the flexibility might be useful for certain extensions or changes later on.

3. **Thread-Safe**: It's **thread-safe**, making it a good choice in multi-threaded environments like the one you're working in (e.g., where multiple threads can process trades concurrently).

4. **Fair Ordering**: When used in a concurrent environment, `LinkedBlockingDeque` provides **fair ordering** (FIFO) between producers and consumers, so you won't have issues with starvation or unfair processing of elements.

### Comparison with Other Blocking Queues

#### 1. **ArrayBlockingQueue**
- **Bounded**: Unlike `LinkedBlockingDeque`, it requires a fixed capacity. If you expect a controlled number of trades or want explicit blocking when the queue is full, this might be a good choice.
- **Circular Array**: It uses a circular array for its storage. This can be slightly faster in terms of memory access patterns compared to a linked list.
- **FIFO**: Like `LinkedBlockingDeque`, `ArrayBlockingQueue` provides a **first-in-first-out** ordering of elements.

**When to use?** When you want to limit the number of trades in the queue and prefer fixed, bounded storage.

#### 2. **PriorityBlockingQueue**
- **Unbounded**: Like `LinkedBlockingDeque`, it can grow dynamically.
- **Order by Priority**: Elements are ordered based on their natural order or a provided comparator. This is great if you want to prioritize certain trades (e.g., by trade size or timestamp).

**When to use?** When certain trades should be processed with higher priority over others (e.g., urgent trades should be handled first).

#### 3. **SynchronousQueue**
- **No Internal Capacity**: Every `put` operation must wait for a `take`, and vice versa. This queue holds no elements. It’s used when handoff between threads is immediate.

**When to use?** If you need direct handoff between producers and consumers, but this wouldn’t fit your current use case since you’re queuing multiple trades.

#### 4. **DelayQueue**
- **Delayed Processing**: It allows elements to be consumed only after a specified delay has passed. This is more specialized and not a fit for your current scenario.

**When to use?** When trades or tasks need to be delayed before being processed.

### Which One to Choose?
- **`LinkedBlockingDeque`**: Flexible, unbounded by default, thread-safe, and allows double-ended operations (though you may not need that right away).
- **`ArrayBlockingQueue`**: Good if you want a fixed-size queue and strict memory control.
- **`PriorityBlockingQueue`**: If prioritizing certain trades is important.
- **`SynchronousQueue`**: If you're directly handing off trades one by one, though it doesn't seem necessary for your current design.

**`LinkedBlockingDeque`** seems to fit well, but if you want to limit the size of the queue or prioritize certain trades, you could go with `ArrayBlockingQueue` or `PriorityBlockingQueue`.
